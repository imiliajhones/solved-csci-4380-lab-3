Functional Dependencies and Data NormalizationThis homework will focus on the concepts of Functional Dependencies and their use in normalizing a relaÂ¬tional schema.

1. Assume the existence of a relation R(a, b, c, d, e, f) with functional dependencies ef -+ c, bc -+ d, de -+ ab, and f -+ c.(a) (2 points) Compute f, b+(b) (4 points) What functional dependencies can we infer from the computed closure (use only singleton right-hand sides)?(c) (3 points) Are any of the inferred functional dependencies part of a minimal basis? Why or why not?

(d) (2 points) Find the key(s) of R

(e) (3 points) Is bc -+ d a violation of Third Normal Form (3NF)? Why or why not?

(f) (6 points) Decompose R into 3NF
